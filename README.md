## Install

- **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/ajainvivek/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
```

And then install the dependencies with yarn.

```bash

## Starting Development

```bash
$ yarn dev
```
